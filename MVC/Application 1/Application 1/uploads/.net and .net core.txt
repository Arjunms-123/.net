ASP.NET Web Forms and ASP.NET Core are both frameworks for building web applications, but they have significant differences in architecture, design philosophy, and capabilities. Here’s a comparison of the two:
1. Framework Type

    ASP.NET Web Forms:
        A part of the .NET Framework, which is primarily designed for building web applications using a drag-and-drop interface and an event-driven model.
        It is tightly coupled with Windows and IIS (Internet Information Services).

    ASP.NET Core:
        A cross-platform, open-source framework that is designed to build modern web applications and APIs.
        It is modular and can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux, making it more versatile.

2. Architecture

    ASP.NET Web Forms:
        Uses a page-based architecture where each page is a separate entity, and the state is managed through ViewState.
        The framework abstracts much of the HTTP protocol, which can lead to less control over the HTML and HTTP requests.

    ASP.NET Core:
        Follows a more modern, lightweight architecture based on middleware, allowing developers to have fine-grained control over the request pipeline.
        Encourages the use of MVC (Model-View-Controller) or Razor Pages, promoting separation of concerns and better organization of code.

3. Development Model

    ASP.NET Web Forms:
        Primarily event-driven, where user interactions trigger server-side events.
        Uses server controls that encapsulate HTML and behavior, which can lead to a more complex rendering process.

    ASP.NET Core:
        Supports a more flexible development model, including MVC, Razor Pages, and Web APIs.
        Encourages the use of client-side frameworks and libraries, allowing for a more responsive and interactive user experience.

4. State Management

    ASP.NET Web Forms:
        Relies heavily on ViewState to maintain the state of controls between postbacks, which can lead to increased page size and performance issues.

    ASP.NET Core:
        Does not use ViewState. Instead, it encourages statelessness and provides various options for state management, such as session state, cookies, and caching.

5. Performance

    ASP.NET Web Forms:
        Generally slower due to the overhead of ViewState and the page lifecycle model.

    ASP.NET Core:
        Designed for high performance and scalability. It has a lightweight architecture and is optimized for modern web development.

6. Cross-Platform Support

    ASP.NET Web Forms:
        Limited to Windows environments and requires IIS for hosting.

    ASP.NET Core:
        Fully cross-platform, allowing applications to run on Windows, macOS, and Linux. It can be hosted on various servers, including Kestrel, Nginx, and Apache.

7. Dependency Injection

    ASP.NET Web Forms:
        Does not have built-in support for dependency injection, which can make testing and managing dependencies more challenging.

    ASP.NET Core:
        Has built-in support for dependency injection, making it easier to manage dependencies and improve testability.

8. Community and Ecosystem

    ASP.NET Web Forms:
        While still supported, it is considered a legacy technology, and the community is moving towards newer frameworks.

    ASP.NET Core:
        Actively developed and supported by Microsoft, with a growing community and ecosystem. It is the recommended framework for new web applications.

Conclusion

In summary, ASP.NET Web Forms is a mature framework suitable for certain types of applications, especially those that require rapid development with a familiar event-driven model. However, ASP.NET Core is the modern, flexible, and high-performance framework that is recommended for new web applications, offering cross-platform support, better performance, and a more modular architecture. If you're starting a new project, ASP.NET Core is generally the better choice.
